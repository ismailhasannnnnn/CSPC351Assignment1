## How to Run

 1. Compile sender.cpp and recv.cpp using the 'make all' command.
 2. Make sure you have a 'keyfile.txt' with whatever you'd like to send to the receiver program. 
 3. Run the receiver first using the command 'sudo ./receiver'.
 4. Run the sender program, using the keyfile as a parameter. E.g. 'sudo ./sender keyfile.txt'
